    "question": "Remember, it's important to express this gently and with empathy. Does this help?",
    "answer": "Of course, here's a more detailed approach:\n\n\"Firstly, I want to acknowledge your feelings and the pain my past actions have caused. I deeply regret how I behaved and the impact it had on you. I understand why you find it hard to trust and why you wish things had started differently. I wish that too. Since then, I've been making a conscious effort to better myself. I've sought help, worked on my mental health, and strived to become a person who can be there for you in the way you deserve. I hope you've seen these changes in me. However, I've realized that for us to truly move forward, we need to find a way to leave the past behind. I can't change what happened, but I can assure you that I've learned from my mistakes and am committed to our relationship now more than ever. While I understand the past still hurts, I feel it's important for both of us to focus on the present and the future we're building together. The constant reminders of the past make it difficult for me to show you the person I've become and they also affect my emotional well-being. I'm not asking you to forget, but to try and see the changes in me and give us a chance to create happier memories moving forward. I believe in us and our ability to grow stronger from our experiences. I hope this is something we can work on together. If we find it challenging, I'm open to seeking professional help to guide us through this process.\"\nRemember, it's essential to keep the conversation open and respectful. How does this sound?
